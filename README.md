# XBRL-AI

The purpuse off this project is to apply XBRL in AI and Machine learning, by usage of Python.

The project will be divided into 3 part:
1. Generic XBRL to AI.
  * xbrl_ai.py
2. XBRL in Danish GAAP og Danish IFRS (with extension) to AI
  * xbrl_ai_dk.py
3. Sample of Machine Learning implementation based on this project
  * test_xbrl_ai_dk.py

## Why this project?

Working with machine learning basicly comes down to one thing: y = f(X), y is that we wants to predict, X is the input og f is the machine learning model. Unfortunately X hardly ever fits into to f. If we wants to fit eg. an XBRL-instance into to f, we need to prepare the data. XBRL needs a good representation to fit into AI and Machine learning.

Creating a good and standardlised representation of XBRL into AI and Machine learning are the main purpose of this project.
